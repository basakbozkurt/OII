# Statistical Analysis Code for "The Impact of Domestic Monitoring on Electoral Integrity" Paper

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the statistical code used in the study examining the impact of domestic monitoring organisations on electoral integrity. The study addresses a significant gap in the literature by focusing on domestic monitors rather than international ones, using cross-national data.

The analysis employs **panel data regression** to assess how domestic monitoring influences electoral integrity. The findings suggest that while domestic monitoring positively impacts electoral integrity, this effect diminishes in environments with weaker electoral management bodies or less active civil society participation.
